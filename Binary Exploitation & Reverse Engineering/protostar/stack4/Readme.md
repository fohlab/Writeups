# Stack4 Challenge

This challenge is a small variation of the previous one, only in this case we have no function pointer. Therefore, in order to call `win()` we have to alter the **Instruction pointer** **$eip**.

You can find the source code here <a href="https://exploit-exercises.lains.space/protostar/stack4/">here</a>.

```c

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void win()
{
  printf("code flow successfully changed\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char buffer[64];

  gets(buffer);
}
```

**Disassembled**

<!-- disas -->

Let's create a random pattern so we can identify when our instruction pointer is overwritten. Visit https://zerosum0x0.blogspot.com/2016/11/overflow-exploit-pattern-generator.html so you can quickly generate a pattern and copy it.

Now open the program in gdb and run it.

<!-- input pattern -->

We can see that **eip** was overwritten with **0x63413563**.
